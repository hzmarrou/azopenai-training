# Developing a conversational AI for your data platfrom 

In this lab, we are going to construct a conversational AI specifically for your data platform. The integration of such an AI into your platform can greatly enhance accessibility, efficiency, and the overall user experience. This AI simplifies the process of accessing and understanding complex data by allowing users to pose queries in natural language and receive succinct responses, thereby eliminating the need for laborious manual data sorting. Moreover, the AI has the capability to retrieve and analyze data faster than traditional methods, delivering specific metrics or analyses instantly and saving valuable time and resources. Additionally, a conversational AI offers a more interactive and engaging user experience by enabling users to 'converse' with the data, which makes the process of data analysis more intuitive and less daunting.

### Understanding the metadata csv file. 

The CSV `metadata.csv` file is filled with over 2000 fictitious metadata entries from more than 2000 golden datasets. This business metadata includes essential details such as the dataset name, the data owner's name, and a comprehensive description of each dataset.

 
### Challenge     

Construct a conversational bot capable of addressing queries about this metadata. I believe this exercise will prove beneficial, as it could inspire you to develop a similar solution for their own data platform. I encourage everyone to attend. I hope you can make it.
