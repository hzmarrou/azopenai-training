    "# Intro to Semantic Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the release of ChatGPT, Large language models (LLMs) have received a huge amount of attention in both industry and the media; resulting in an unprecedented demand to try and leverage LLMs in almost every conceivable context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic Kernel is an open-source SDK originally developed by Microsoft to power products such as Microsoft 365 Copilot and Bing, designed to make it easy to integrate LLMs into applications. It enables users to leverage LLMs to orchestrate workflows based on natural language queries and commands by making it possible to connect these models with external services that provide additional functionality the model can use to complete tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it was created with the Microsoft ecosystem in mind, many of the complex examples currently available are written in C#, with fewer resources focusing on the Python SDK. In this blog post, we shall demonstrate how to get started with the Semantic Kernel using Python, introducing the key components and exploring how these can be used to perform various tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note**:  Semantic Kernel, like everything related to related to LLMs, is moving incredibly fast. As such, interfaces may change slightly over time; we will try to keep this post updated where we can. Whilst we work for Microsoft, we am not asked to, or compensated for, promoting Semantic Kernel in any way. \n",

    "### Orchestrating workflows with a Planner\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we have thoroughly explored semantic functions, understand how functions can be grouped and used as part of a plugin, and have seen how we can chain plugins together manually. Now, let's explore how we can create and orchestrate workflows using LLMs. To do this, Semantic Kernel provides `Planner` objects, which can dynamically create chains of functions to try and achieve a goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "A planner is a class that takes a user prompt and a kernel, and uses the kernel's services to create a plan of how to perform the task, using the functions and plugins that have been made available to the kernel. As the plugins are the main building blocks of these plans, the planner relies heavily on the descriptions provided; if plugins and functions don't have clear descriptions, the planner will not be able to use them correctly. Additionally, as a planner can combine functions in various different ways, it is important to ensure that we only expose functions that we are happy for the planner to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the planner relies on a model to generate a plan, there can be errors introduced; these usually arise when the planner doesn't properly understand how to use the function. In these cases, we havefound that providing explicit instructions - such as describing the inputs and outputs, and stating whether inputs are required - in the descriptions can lead to better results. Additionally, we havehad better results using instruction tuned models than base models; base text completion models tend to hallucinate functions that don't exist or create multiple plans. Despite these limitations, when everything works correctly, planners can be incredibly powerful!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore how we can do this by exploring if we can create a plan to write a poem about an image, based on its url; using the plugins we created earlier. As we have defined lots of functions that we no longer need, let's create a new kernel, so we can control which functions are exposed."

However, running this multiple times with the same prompt, we can see that this is not always the case, so it is important to double check your plan before running it! For me personally, in a production system, I would feel much more comfortable manually creating the workflow to execute, rather than leaving it to the LLM! As the technology continues to improve, especially at the current rate, hopefully this recommendation will become outdated!"
