    "### What is LangChain?\n",
    "> LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TLDR**: LangChain makes the complicated parts of working & building with AI models easier. It helps do this in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integration** - Bring external data, such as your files, other applications, and api data, to your LLMs\n",
    "2. **Agency** - Allow your LLMs to interact with it's environment via decision making. Use LLMs to help decide which action to take next\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LangChain?\n",
    "1. **Components** - LangChain makes it easy to swap out abstractions and components necessary to work with language models.\n",
    "2. **Customized Chains** - LangChain provides out of the box support for using and customizing 'chains' - a series of actions strung together.\n",
    "3. **Speed** - LangChain team ships insanely fast. You'll be up to date with the latest LLM features.\n",
    "4. **Community** - Wonderful discord and community support, meet ups, hackathons, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though LLMs can be straightforward `(text-in, text-out)` you'll quickly run into friction points that LangChain helps with once you develop more complicated applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: This cookbook will not cover all aspects of LangChain. It's contents have been curated to get you to building & impact as quick as possible. For more, please check out [LangChain Conceptual Documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/)*"

They had hardly any plot,\\njust characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them\\ndeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our\\nschool district used for what was then called \"data processing.\"\\nThis was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14.

The\\nresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly\\nloud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with\\nit.

The only other\\noption was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate\\napproximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything\\ninteresting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any\\nprograms I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest\\nmemory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not\\nto terminate, when one of mine didn't.

What I discovered when\\nI got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the\\nspace of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed\\nultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases\\nthat people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18.

So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things\\nespecially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein\\ncalled The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent\", metadata={'source': 'data/PaulGrahamEssays/worked.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry\\nWinograd using SHRDLU.

You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose\\nwhatever you liked to put on your degree.

Which in turn means\\nthat prestige is a danger sign.When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do\\nfreelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and\\nthis was how I survived for the next several years.
