    "*This Notebook is based on the [LangChain Conceptual Documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inspire you to build\n",
    "2. Provide an introductory understanding of the main use cases of LangChain examples and code snippets. For an introduction to the *fundamentals* of LangChain check out [Cookbook Part 1: Fundamentals]\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Main Use Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Summarization** - Express the most important facts about a body of text or chat interaction\n",
    "* **Question and Answering Over Documents** - Use information held within documents to answer questions or query\n",
    "* **Extraction** - Pull structured data from a body of text or an user query\n",
    "* **Evaluation** - Understand the quality of output from your application\n",
    "* **Querying Tabular Data** - Pull data from databases or other tabular source\n",
    "* **Code Understanding** - Reason about and digest code\n",
    "* **Interacting with APIs** - Query APIs and interact with the outside world\n",
    "* **Chatbots** - A framework to have a back and forth interaction with a user combined with memory in a chat interface\n",
    "* **Agents** - Use LLMs to make decisions about what to do next. Enable these decisions with tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Authors Note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* This cookbook will not cover all aspects of LangChain. It's contents have been curated to get you to building & impact as quick as possible. For more, please check out [LangChain Technical Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html)\n",
    "* This notebook assumes is that you've seen part 1 of this series [Fundamentals](https://github.com/). This notebook is focused on what to do and how to apply those fundamentals.\n",
    "* You'll notice I repeat import statements throughout the notebook. My intention is to lean on the side of clarity and help you see the full code block in one spot. No need to go back and forth to see when we imported a package.\n",
    "* We use the default models throughout the notebook, at the time of writing they were davinci-003 and gpt-3.5-turbo. You would no doubt get better results with GPT4\n",

Continue with 15 minutes of icing three times a day until the pain and swelling subside. Sprains happen when a ligament is torn or damaged, usually when one of your joints moves further than it should. Muscle strains happen when one of your muscles is torn. People also sometimes call strains pulled muscles or muscle tears. Providers sometimes call tendon tears strains. Sprains and strains are both common sports injuries. Acute ankle sprains are commonly seen in both primary care practices and emergency departments and can result in significant short-term morbidity, recurrent injuries, and functional instability. Appropriate initial evaluation and treatment can decrease the likelihood of these complications. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of ... Apply the ice for 30 minutes, then take it off for 30 minutes, and so on. Compression: Use compression in the early phase of ankle sprain treatment. Using an elastic wrap (like an Ace bandage), wrap the ankle from the toes all the way up to the top of the calf muscle, overlapping the elastic wrap by one-half of the width of the wrap. Ice can minimize the pain and swelling caused by a sprained ankle. Try to treat initial swelling immediately after the injury by applying ice to your ankle. This can be a slush bath, a store-bought ice pack, or a simple plastic bag filled with ice. Limit the time you apply ice to 15-20 minutes at a time.'"
